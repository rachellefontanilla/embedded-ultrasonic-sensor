# Embedded Ultrasonic Sensor
The firmware code for a rotating object sensor using an STM32 Nucleo Board.

## Organization
The following projects were used to test the different external components of the final project:
- ADC_Test
- Blink_Test
- PWM_Blink_Test
- Servo_Test
- Timer_Blink_Test
- UART_Test
- US100_Test

This folder is the final sensor project that builds on the previous components:
- UDAR_Project

The code for each of these projects can be found in **folder > Core > Src > main.c**
